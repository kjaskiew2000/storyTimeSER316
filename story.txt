Once upon a time in a huge castle near Berlin a dog was seen.
Rammstein was heard playing throughout the castle, as the dog was trotting around wearing lederhose.
The scent of gabaeck caught the dog's attention so he dashed out the castle to the nearest baeckerei.
In front of the baeckerei the dog found a young men sitting in a beer garden eating some pastries.
The dog ran through Hauptstrasse, following a sleek Porsche that flew past the bustling Ratskeller.
Close by, the tempting smell of warm Apfelkuchen drifting from the Baeckerie took the dog's attention from the chase. 
In a Dirndel, Miss Mehlhase the baker, looked down to see a black dog in Lederhose, thumping his tail expectantly for just a nibble of the Gebaeck.
With a smile and a pat on the head, she grabbed a Bratwurst and a piece of Brot which the dog happily took and went trotting off with his prize.
The hund found a cozy spot to sun-bathe and eat his treat in the park as he watched wettbewerbsfaehig children play a game.
In the warmth of the sun, he dreamt about playing poker with other dogs at the biergarten, with his prize money he filled the entire Schloss with Gebaek, Doener, Brot, and Bratwurst.
The hund was awoken from the sound of a BMW M2 speeding by.
Während der Apfelkuchen in den Rathauskeller geliefert wurde, backte Mehlhase in der Bäckerei Brot und Gebäck.
