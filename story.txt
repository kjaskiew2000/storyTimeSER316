Once upon a time in a huge castle near Berlin a dog was seen.
Rammstein was heard playing throughout the castle, as the dog was trotting around wearing lederhose.
The scent of gabaeck caught the dog's attention so he dashed out the castle to the nearest baeckerei.
In front of the baeckerei the dog found a young men sitting in a beer garden eating some pastries.
